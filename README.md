# Projects

## University Projects

### ```Static Site Generator```

The main goal was to create a static site generator that takes files in Markdown format and creates the HTML. Six people were involved in the creation of this project.We used some design patterns, CI, CD, and Docker.

### ```Local Procedure Call```

We created a server-side and also the client-side. The server is waiting for client requests. Whenever a client is connecting server creates a subprocess to respond to the request. One of the difficulties was to play with pointers and make a function call using them. We used mutexes, shared memory, conditions, sockets - to name a few.

### ```Framework for Card Games```

We made a framework to add new card games to the program without changing the core. Of course, an MVC design pattern is present to structure the program. Defining the correct controller for every game, we were able to avoid repeating some rules. In this way, we respected the concept of DRY (don't repeat yourself).

### ```RSS Flux```

Using Kotlin, we made an Android app to manage RSS. We used an internal database to store data.
